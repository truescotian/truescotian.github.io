            <h2>I'm Greg Miller. A Backend Developer based in Halifax.</h2>
            <p class="bio">
              I think you'll find I'm one of the most passionate developers you'll work with. I create software covering
              all facets you'd expect of an experienced developer, starting with accountability for the successes,
              failures, and maintenance of projects
            </p>
            <p class="bio">
              Coming from a start-up environment and integrating into a medium-sized company after an acquisition has
              taught me many things. I’ve learned both how not to manage a team through my failures, and how to properly
              manage a team by iterating my processes many times over. The most important lessons I’ve learned are to
              trust developers, prevent silos (to an extent), and hire people that strive for high-quality results.

        <h1>Brain Dump of Lessons Learned</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Refactoring is important. Even in startups. It saves you from a nightmare later on if you're maintaining it
            years later.
          </li>
          <li>Do the most correct solution, even if it's more work.</li>
          <li>Have a programmer to look up to and aspire to be as good as them.</li>
          <li>Hire people, don't contract it out.</li>
          <li>Spread knowledge between teams, prevent silos.</li>
          <li>Do not be forced in to a leadership position if you don't want it (Peter Principle).</li>
          <li>Use typed languages.</li>
          <li>Version your APIs</li>
          <li>Do not overcomplicate. Be as simple as possible with everything. Be resistent to breaking changes.</li>
          <li>E2E tests and integration tests are important.</li>
          <li>Prevent regressions.</li>
          <li>In a start-up you'll work too much. It'll be worth it if you succeed.</li>
          <li>Don't wait for a mentor, they probably wont come.</li>
          <li>Try not to use inheritance.</li>
          <li>Don't OOP on frontend.</li>
          <li>
            Managers need to make the most use of their best developers. The best developers want / crave a hard problem
            to solve.
          </li>
          <li>If you're unprepared, not engaged, or are not on the ball, people instantly notice.</li>
