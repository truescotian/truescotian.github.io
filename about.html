            <h2>I'm Greg Miller. A Backend Developer based in Halifax.</h2>
            <p class="bio">
              I think you'll find I'm one of the most passionate developers
              you'll ever get to work with. I create software covering all
              facets you'd expect of a solid developer, starting with
              accountability for the successes, failures, and maintenance of
              projects
            </p>
            <p class="bio">
              Coming from a start-up environment and integrating into a
              medium-sized company after an acquisition has taught me many
              things. I’ve learned both how not to manage a team through my
              failures, and how to properly manage a team by iterating my
              processes many times over. The most important lessons I’ve learned
              are to be open in all communication, prevent silos (to an extent),
              and hire people that strive for high-quality results.

        <h1>Brain Dump of Lessons Learned</h1>

        <ul>
          <li>People in start-ups are generally self-starters.</li>
          <li>
            Refactoring is very important. Even in startups. It saves you from a
            nightmare later on if you're maintaining it years later.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have a programmer to look up to and aspire to be as good as them.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you hire a third-party to contract software to give to you, there
            will be an information silo and that is a nightmare.
          </li>
          <li>Spread knowledge between teams, prevent silos.</li>
          <li>
            Junior developers seem to have great ideas and want to tear things
            apart to make them better. They are junior because they don't know
            the repercussions, or why the code became that in the first place.
            It was probably because the programmer was on a tight schedule then
            was never given time to go back and clean it up.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't listen to people that say you shouldn't learn something. They
            end up behind you.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some people like knowledge breadth and end up not knowing anything
            deeply, which is fine. I prefer learning deeply.
          </li>
          <li>
            If something is really bothering you at work, even management, then
            bring it up, demand it be fixed, and if it isn't then leave. If
            you're good you'll have a new job in no time.
          </li>
          <li>
            The saying that the people that should lead don't want to lead is
            true. Do not be forced in to a leadership position if you don't want
            it. Read about the Peter Principle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Document. If you don't document, the next person will look at your
            monster of code and have no idea how things work without trial and
            error.
          </li>
          <li>
            When something someone says confuses you, ask them to explain it to
            you like you're 5, with screenshots or any visual if possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            You'll look dumb when you don't ask for clarification and get it
            wrong. Ask for clarification before starting.
          </li>
          <li>Use typed languages.</li>
          <li>Version your APIs</li>
          <li>
            When somebody tells you to add something like Kafka, Rabbitmq, or
            some other tech when something you already have is doing fine,
            ignore them. They're wrong and probably read a couple articles.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not overcomplicate. Be as simple as possible with everything. Be
            resistent to breaking changes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Almost always people don't know what they're doing and are faking
            it. Your DevOps guy knows OAuth, AWS, GCP, Terraform, etc? All of
            it? Really? No they don't. Some people are really good though, be
            around them.
          </li>
          <li>E2E tests are great.</li>
          <li>Prevent regressions.</li>
          <li>
            In a start-up you'll work too much. It'll be worth it if you
            succeed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not having a leader sucks. Not having a mentor sucks. You think
            you're not learning the right stuff, but if you keep learning in
            your area of expertise, you'll still get further than many others. I
            thought I needed a mentor, but it turns out I don't.
          </li>
          <li>
            Titles are BS. None of us are engineers unless you're really an
            engineer. If you are, props to you. I know I couldn't pass that
            exam.
          </li>
          <li>Stop using inheritance.</li>
          <li>Own your failures. Just do better next time.</li>
          <li>
            If you're a manager and aren't making the most use of your best
            developers, you're managing wrong. The best developers want / crave
            a hard problem to solve.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some people are great at working remotely. Some hardly work
            remotely.
          </li>
          <li>
            Modern tech is fun. Use it if you're starting a new project, but
            make sure it's the right tool for the job.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you come prepared, engaged, and are on the ball, people will
            think you're amazing. The good people find you when you do this.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you're unprepared, not engaged, or are not on the ball, people
            instantly notice.
