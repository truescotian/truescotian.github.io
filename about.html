            <h2>I'm Greg Miller. A Backend Developer based in Halifax.</h2>
            <p class="bio">
              I think you'll find I'm one of the most passionate developers
              you'll ever get to work with. I create software covering all
              facets you'd expect of a solid developer, starting with
              accountability for the successes, failures, and maintenance of
              projects
            </p>
            <p class="bio">
              Coming from a start-up environment and integrating into a
              medium-sized company after an acquisition has taught me many
              things. I’ve learned both how not to manage a team through my
              failures, and how to properly manage a team by iterating my
              processes many times over. The most important lessons I’ve learned
              are to be open in all communication, prevent silos (to an extent),
              and hire people that strive for high-quality results.
