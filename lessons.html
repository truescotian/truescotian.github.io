          A good mentor takes a long time to find and may never come. Enjoy
          learning on your own and you'll find the right way to do things along
          the way.
        </li>
        <li>
          Unless you own the product and really care, you will only have two of:
          features, speed, and quality.
        </li>
        <li>Learn observability.</li>
        <li>Measure before optimizing.</li>
        <li>Hire employees over contractors.</li>
        <li>
          Spread knowledge between teams, prevent silos. However, if you have a
          silo, keep it for job security!
        </li>
        <li>
          Learn IC and EM. After discovering which you enjoy more, stick with
          it. Don't let a company choose your path.
        </li>
        <li>Use typed languages.</li>
        <li>Version APIs.</li>
        <li>Do not create breaking changes.</li>
        <li>E2E tests and integration tests are the important ones.</li>
        <li>Composition over inheritance.</li>
        <li>
          As a manager, make the most use of your best developers. The best
          developers want/crave a hard problem to solve.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you're unprepared or unengaged, your colleagues already know.
        </li>
        <li>
          Code should be simple and easy to read. Learn how to name things. Do
          not write fancy code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Not all dependencies are mapped out in the beginning of a big project,
          and you have to accept that as a developer, unfortunately.
        </li>
        <li>
          The language you choose to write in can dictate how well you code. If
          you're in JavaScript all day, you will not be a great developer, and
          you're missing out on a lot of interesting language features.
