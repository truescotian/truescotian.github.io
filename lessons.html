          A good mentor takes a long time to find and may never come. Keep
          learning on your own and you'll find the right way to do things along
          the way.
        </li>
        <li>You can only have two of: features, speed, and quality.</li>
        <li>Don't sacrifice reliability.</li>
        <li>Log a lot and learn observability.</li>
        <li>Measure then optimize.</li>
        <li>Hire people, don't contract.</li>
        <li>
          Spread knowledge between teams, prevent silos. However, if you have a
          silo, keep it for job security.
        </li>
        <li>
          Learn IC and EM. After discovering which you enjoy more, stick with
          it. Don't let a company choose your path.
        </li>
        <li>Use typed languages.</li>
        <li>Version your APIs.</li>
        <li>Try to prevent breaking changes.</li>
        <li>E2E tests and integration tests are the important ones.</li>
        <li>Composition over inheritance.</li>

          Managers need to make the most use of their best developers. The best
          developers want/crave a hard problem to solve.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you're unprepared or unengaged, your colleagues already know.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do not write fancy code. Code should be simple and easy to read.
