        <li>
          In a larger organization with shared libraries, it's helpful to have
          everyone speaking the same language, especially with releases. Use
          <a link href="https://semver.org/">Semver.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          I don't love it, however, when many developers have poor commit
          practices, help with good habits using something like
          <a link href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/"
            >Conventional Commits.</a
          >
          Though you may squash commits as part of a PR, it is nonetheless good
          practice to have readable commit messages. It may save your ass in the
          future.
        </li>
        <li>Don't block PRs due to nitpicks.</li>
        <li>
          Don't take PR reviews personally. They're great feedback and help you
          grow.
        </li>
        <li>
          Funny enough, devs want silos for job security, however, Senior+ try
          to prevent silos.

          A good mentor may never come. Enjoy learning and you'll discover the
          right way to do things along the way.

          Unless you own the product and really care, you will only have two of:
          features, speed, and quality.
        </li>
        <li>
          The language you choose to write in can dictate how well you code. If
          you're in JavaScript all day, you will not be a great developer, and
          you're missing out on a lot of interesting language features.
        </li>
        <li>Setup great observability.</li>
        <li>Measure before optimizing.</li>
        <li>Use typed languages.</li>
        <li>Version APIs.</li>
        <li>Try not to create breaking changes.</li>
        <li>E2E tests and integration tests are the important ones.</li>
        <li>Composition over inheritance.</li>
        <li>
          As a manager, make the most use of your best developers. The best want
          more than writing APIs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Code should be simple and easy to read. Learn how to name things. Do
          not write fancy code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accept that not all dependencies are mapped out in the beginning of a
          big project.
