      <p>This is the personal website for Greg Miller. This is simply my place on the internet to put things I want, and it is not specific to my career.</p>

      <p>I'm only 30 years old, and over the last 10 years, I have begun to find out what it's like to change over time and start to really think about it. There are some important things that I've learned in the last while. Maybe some of those things are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Other cultures change my views wildly. I haven't travelled too much, but it has helped me get out of my comfort zone by finding new things to enjoy, such as food, art, style, finding people that share my values, people with different views, and much more. Travelling allows me to find new ways of thinking, and might be an essential part of a good life in my eyes.</li>
        <li>Three of the most important men in my life were handymen; one grandfather was an engineer, the other was a reverend, and my Father is an engineer. They all have three things in common: to use quality materials, the preference for things to be done right the first time, and learning the skills to do it themselves. I've found that I've taken on that mindset, and it has shaped who I am. One of the important things I'm looking forward to in the next 10 years is having a home to work on and a place to do woodwork and other creative work.</li>
        <li>My friends are the most important thing in my life. Without them, I'd be a different person.</li>
        <li>Originality is maybe the most important quality I've found in people. There's nothing like finding others who value originality. I love it when people do their best to think creatively and independently. On that note, I think AI is poison to originality, and will keep us from being our most creative and independent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Hobbies: woodworking, travelling, reading, motorcycling, camping,
        cycling, snowboarding, hiking.
      </p>

      <h2>Programming</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Staff Developer at GreenShield Labs, where I'm mainly writing code and standardizing processes for Platform, Pharmacy, Telemedicine, and CBT. 
        I enjoy the programming work and prefer processes to make developers' lives easier, making sure it does not become a burden or red tape.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        On my own time, I enjoy making interpreters and creating small games. My favourite language is Go and I could live without JavaScript and TypeScript.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        To write code, I use Neovim. To read code, I use vscode. Additionally, I use powerlevel10k, tmux, and Rectangle.
